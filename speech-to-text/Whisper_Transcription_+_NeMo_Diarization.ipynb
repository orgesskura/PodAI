        "This code provides a method for disambiguating speaker labels in cases where a sentence is split between two different speakers. It uses punctuation markings to determine the dominant speaker for each sentence in the transcription.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Speaker A: It's got to come from somewhere else. Yeah, that one's also fun because you know the lows are\n",
        "Speaker B: going to suck, right? So it's actually it hits you on both sides.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a sentence is split between two speakers, the code takes the mode of speaker labels for each word in the sentence, and uses that speaker label for the whole sentence. This can help to improve the accuracy of speaker diarization, especially in cases where the Whisper model may not take fine utterances like \"hmm\" and \"yeah\" into account, but the Diarization Model (Nemo) may include them, leading to inconsistent results.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code also handles cases where one speaker is giving a monologue while other speakers are making occasional comments in the background. It ignores the comments and assigns the entire monologue to the speaker who is speaking the majority of the time. This provides a robust and reliable method for realigning speech segments to their respective speakers based on punctuation in the transcription."
